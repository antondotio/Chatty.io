### Running the Application

Welcome to peachAt! A new chat app with an adorable color palette that's as soft and sweet as a peach!

To run this application, you need to use two terminals.

In your first terminal type in

```
cd backend
npm i
node index.js
```

This simply runs the backend of the code.

In your second terminal type in

```
cd frontend
npm i
npm start
```

This will run the front end of the code and there will be a browser window that will automatically open on run.

### Changes

I made a change to the way a user can change their nickname and color. Rather than using a text command, users must simply press the Update Profile button to open up a window that prompts the user to change their nickname or color or both. This way it's a lot more practical.
